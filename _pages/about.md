Howdy!

I'm a second year Masters student in the Computer Science Department of University of Illinois at Chicago. I work as a Research Assistant for DREAM lab under Professor Jida Huang to help leverage Deep Learning methods in the domain of Manufacturing. I also work as a Teaching Assistant for IE 542 & ME 542 Advanced computational methods for Product and Process Design courses. My main research interest is the design of efficient and provable machine learning and deep learning algorithms and more specifically 3D Computer Vision. In general, I like solving mathematical problems based on linear algebra, probability & statistics, optimization, etc. which are ubiquitous in machine learning and applying them to real world applications.

Previously, I was a bachelor student in the Department of Information Technology Engineering, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College which is affiliated to Mumbai University.
