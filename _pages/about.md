Howdy!

I'm a first year Masters student in the Computer Science Department of University of Illinois at Chicago. My main research interest is the design of efficient and provable machine learning and deep learning algorithms. In general, I like solving mathematical problems based on linear algebra, probability & statistics, optimization, etc. which are ubiquitous in machine learning and applying them to real world applications

Previously, I was a bachelor student in the Department of Information Technology Engineering, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College which is affiliated to Mumbai University.
